# MyOS Guard Dog 4.1

VirusTotal requests are paced within each process, including retries and refreshes.
Separate processes or other software sharing the same API key can still exhaust its
quota. Rate limits leave coverage incomplete; they never turn into a clean result.

MyOS Guard Dog checks software packages before installation and rechecks your projects against current security information. Its only supported command is `myos-guard-dog`. It is not affiliated with DataDog GuardDog or other similarly named packages. The official source is [josephtandle/myos-guard-dog](https://github.com/josephtandle/myos-guard-dog).

## Install with your AI assistant

Use the [installation prompt](GUARD_DOG_PROMPT.md). It guides your assistant through setup, a first audit, VirusTotal verification, scheduling, repairs, and a completion report.

For a terminal installation on macOS, Windows, or Linux, use Node 24 LTS. Other major versions are rejected so local installs, CI and support all exercise the same runtime:

```sh
npm install -g --ignore-scripts github:josephtandle/myos-guard-dog#v4.1.0
myos-guard-dog setup
myos-guard-dog test
myos-guard-dog scan "/your/project"
myos-guard-dog doctor --repair
```

On Windows, substitute a quoted Windows folder such as `"C:\Users\You\Projects"`. All Sorted users should use the matching module installer instead of creating a second installation.

State lives in `~/.guardog` or `%USERPROFILE%\.guardog`, independently of the installation directory. `GUARDOG_HOME` selects another state folder. Upgrades preserve this state.

The v4.1.0 command above is for use **after** the v4.1.0 tag is published. Until then, the latest verified public tag is v4.0.3.

## A keyless first check

```sh
myos-guard-dog artifact npm:lodash@4.17.21
myos-guard-dog artifact npm:lodash@4.17.21 --json
myos-guard-dog artifact "/path/to/package.tgz"
```

The `npm:` form requires an exact version. It downloads the public npm archive, checks the registry hostname, release identity and strong registry digest, then reads archive bytes in memory. The local `.tgz` form inspects bytes without proving registry origin. Neither form extracts files, runs package scripts or requires an API key. It reports lifecycle scripts and selected source indicators, including a credential-file read plus outbound network capability in the same file. The inspection has limits on archive size, entry count and text scanned. A result with no indicators is **not** proof that a package is safe.

## Check before installing

```sh
myos-guard-dog install lodash
myos-guard-dog install npm install express@5.1.0
```

The guarded npm installer resolves the full dependency tree in temporary staging with scripts disabled. It verifies exact versions and public npm artifact hashes, runs bounded artifact inspection on those same bytes, then requires completed security checks before installing the approved lockfile. High-risk, review, or uninspectable archive findings stop the guarded install and identify the file and rule for manual review. Lifecycle scripts remain disabled after installation. Packages needing build scripts require a separate review.

Direct npm or pip commands bypass Guard Dog. Guard Dog does not intercept all terminal activity. Unsupported guarded installations, including pip, custom registries, workspaces and local/Git sources, stop with an explanation. They are not silently passed through.

## Audit existing projects

```sh
myos-guard-dog scan "/your/project"
myos-guard-dog-scan "/your/project/package.json" --json
myos-guard-dog analyze node-ipc@10.1.1 npm
myos-guard-dog analyze requests@2.32.3 pypi
```

Project audits read exact npm lockfile versions, including transitive dependencies, and compare installed identity when present. npm lockfile versions 1, 2 and 3 and shrinkwrap files are supported. Non-registry or unproven origins, installed-only packages, and mismatches between installed metadata and the lock make coverage incomplete. Python and Ruby packages can be analyzed individually; automatic project inventory currently covers npm.

## VirusTotal and coverage

OSV vulnerability checks need no API key. VirusTotal malware checks require your own key, entered locally with `myos-guard-dog setup` or supplied through `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`. GitHub metadata requests can use `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to reduce rate limits. Never paste keys into chat or bug reports.

VirusTotal checks SHA-256 reports for the exact package artifact. Old known reports request reanalysis; that request does not count as a fresh result. Reports with no completed engine verdicts, unknown hashes, old results, authentication failures and rate limits remain incomplete. No private files are uploaded. An explicitly supplied URL checks URL reputation, not its downloaded file contents.

Guarded installs require complete OSV and VirusTotal checks and no disqualifying findings. Without a VirusTotal key you can still inspect vulnerability findings, but guarded installs remain blocked. The default freshness limit for stored VirusTotal reports is 24 hours. API usage and access depend on your VirusTotal plan; see its [official API documentation](https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/overview).

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| BARK | Serious evidence found; installation blocked. |
| WHINE | Warning signals need review; installation blocked. |
| SILENT | The completed checks did not reach a warning threshold. Read coverage too. |
| INCOMPLETE | Required evidence is missing. It is not a safe result. |

Audit exit codes are 0 only when completed checks report SAFE, 1 for serious findings, and 2 for suspicious or incomplete coverage or operational failure. Artifact inspection uses 0 for no indicators within its bounded scan, 1 for high-risk indicators, and 2 for review or incomplete inspection. A zero from artifact inspection alone does not certify package safety. Guarded installation has the stricter approval policy.

## Daily scans and self-repair

```sh
myos-guard-dog updates enable --workspace "/your/workspace" --time "02:30"
myos-guard-dog updates status
myos-guard-dog nightly
myos-guard-dog doctor --repair
```

Choose the folders and local run time explicitly. Scheduling uses cron on Mac/Linux and Task Scheduler on Windows, with registration readback. A scan receipt records the last run, project and dependency counts, danger and coverage gaps. An empty run is not reported as successful protection.

Each daily run checks its health first. Safe repairs restore missing state directories, restrict credential-file permissions on POSIX systems, and restore an owned runner or previously enabled missing schedule. Unknown files and jobs are preserved. Overlap and run-time limits prevent endless repair loops. Service retries are bounded. Credentials, unsupported inventories and persistent service outages remain visible for action. Repairs never weaken checks or alter project dependencies.

Setup and nightly runs also maintain `data/resilience-state.json`. This local receipt tracks verified cycles, successful repair counts, healthy streaks and recurring issue categories. A category that survives two cycles is escalated with a concrete next action; a verified healthy cycle clears the active recurrence. It stores categories rather than machine-specific paths or credentials. The loop never rewrites Guard Dog code, changes threat thresholds, selects scan roots, replaces customized jobs or installs project dependencies.

The computer must be available for its scheduler. Use `myos-guard-dog updates disable` to remove the owned schedule. `myos-guard-dog doctor --json` provides machine-readable health. Optional Git hooks are secondary commit checks, not pre-install protection.

## Scope and verification

Guard Dog protects the package workflow. It is not a replacement for operating-system antivirus and does not watch every file or process. Regular `analyze` and `scan` pattern checks read registry description text; `artifact` and guarded `install` now additionally read bounded npm archive source bytes. This static inspection does not execute code, perform a sandboxed behavioral analysis, or cover every obfuscation technique. The CLI queries OSV, registry metadata, GitHub metadata when linked, and optional VirusTotal reports; it does not query NVD or CISA KEV or run name-similarity detection. SILENT describes only those completed checks. No scan guarantees software is harmless. For PyPI releases with multiple distributions, provide the SHA-256 of the exact wheel or source archive to check; without one, artifact coverage is incomplete.

`npm test` runs regression and real packed-install tests. CI runs these on Windows, macOS and Linux with Node 24. Scheduler tests exercise platform command construction and readback without installing real tasks. `npm run test:live` separately exercises public services and may consume API quota. See the release verification record for actual platform results.
